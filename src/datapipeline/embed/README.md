# embed: description embeddings + vector index

Part of the TasteBridge data pipeline (`ingest → preprocess → embed / train`). Owner: YiTong.

## What it does (plain terms)

Every book's blurb is turned into a list of 384 numbers, a "coordinate for meaning", by a
small pre-trained AI model. Books whose blurbs talk about similar things end up close
together. The coordinates are saved, put into a searchable index (ChromaDB), and three
example searches are saved as proof that it works. Books without a usable blurb are
described by title, author and shelf tags instead, and marked as such.

Nothing here changes the backend. At MS3 the hybrid model (M1) uses these coordinates
as one of its inputs.

## Run it

```bash
# whole stack, from the repo root
docker compose up --build

# only this stage
docker compose run --rm embed

# search the index
docker compose run --rm embed python -m embed.query "a heist with a crew of con artists" --k 5 --genre fantasy
```

Local development (from `src/datapipeline/embed`):

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest -q                       # fast tests (fake encoder)
uv run pytest -m slow -q               # real model test (~90 MB download once)
uv run pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing
uv run python scripts/make_synthetic_books.py --out ../../../data/processed/books.parquet  # invented books
```

## Input

`data/processed/books.parquet` from preprocess: `work_id`, `title`, `author`, `description`,
`shelves` (required), plus `has_description`, `year`, `genre` (used when present), and
`data/processed/manifest.json` (`data_version`).

## Output: `data/embeddings/`

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `desc_embeddings.npy` | float32 (num_books × 384), unit-length rows |
| `desc_rows.parquet` | row → `work_id`, `text_source` (`description` / `title_shelves`), `n_chars` |
| `meta.json` | model + revision, input hash, upstream `data_version`, git commit, time |
| `chroma/` | ChromaDB index, collection `book_descriptions`, cosine |
| `retrieval_example.json` / `.md` | example queries → top-5 books |
| `run.log` | log of the run |

The folder is replaced only when a run fully succeeds (written to `embeddings.tmp/` first).
It is versioned with DVC (`dvc pull` to get it), never committed to git.

## Settings (environment variables)

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `EMBED_INPUT` | `/data/processed/books.parquet` |
| `EMBED_OUTPUT_DIR` | `/data/embeddings` |
| `EMBED_MODEL` | `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` |
| `EMBED_MODEL_REVISION` | `1110a243fdf4706b3f48f1d95db1a4f5529b4d41` |
| `EMBED_BATCH_SIZE` | `64` |
| `EMBED_EXAMPLE_QUERIES` | three built-in queries, separated by `\|` |
| `EMBED_EVIDENCE_EXCERPTS` | off (turn on only once the repo is private) |
| `EMBED_CODE_VERSION` | `git rev-parse HEAD` if available |

## How it works (for Q&A)

1. `inputs.py` checks the table (columns, duplicates, empty titles) and stops with exit code 1 and a clear message if something is wrong.
2. `texts.py` builds `"{title} by {author}. {description}"`, or `"{title} by {author}. Shelves: …"` when `has_description` is false (the 40-character rule from `preprocess/quality.py`).
3. `encoder.py` runs the pinned model on CPU with `normalize_embeddings=True`, so the dot product equals cosine similarity.
4. `store.py` writes the arrays and builds the Chroma collection (`hnsw` space `cosine`; similarity = 1 − distance; a genre filter also returns books tagged `both`).
5. `query.py` runs the example searches; the CLI always uses the model recorded in `meta.json`.
6. `run.py` writes to a temp folder and renames it into place at the end.

## Troubleshooting

- **Linux host, permission denied on `/data`**: the container runs as uid 1000; `sudo chown -R 1000 data`.
- **Windows, "Access is denied" when renaming**: Chroma held files open; `release_chroma()` is called before every rename. Report it if you still see this.
- **Image is several GB**: torch isn't the `+cpu` build; check `[tool.uv.sources]` in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Windows warning "To support symlinks on Windows…"** during local runs: harmless; the Hugging Face model cache copies files instead of linking them.
